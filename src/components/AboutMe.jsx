          Hi, I'm Angela! I'm a <span className="bold-font">full-stack software engineer</span> based
          in Minneapolis. I strive to use my knowledge for social good and hold community at the
          center of my work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Offline, you'll find me reading fantasy books, exploring my
          neighborhood by bike, or snuggling with my chiweenie pup.

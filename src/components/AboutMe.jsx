        <p>
          Hello, I'm Angela! I'm a software engineer by day, cozy bookworm by
          night. I started coding as a kid, learning html and css to customize
          my *~ vErY cOoL ~* MySpace page.
        </p>
        <p>
          My focus is in frontend, primarily in React and TypeScript. I love
          building interfaces at the intersection of beautiful design and
          accessibility for all.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working over a decade in the nonprofit sector, specializing in
          database administration, I took a creative leap to pursue a career in
          web development. I bring a passion for growing my knowledge in new
          technologies and patience in finding the missing pieces in a puzzle
        </p>
        <p>
          Offline, you'll find me reading fantasy books, exploring my
          neighborhood by bike, or snuggling with my chiweenie pup Luya.
        </p>
        <p>
          I strive to use my knowledge for social good and hold community at the
          center of my work.
